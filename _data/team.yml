    description: "Currently, I am a PhD student at the University of Edinburgh, working on active sensing with UAV, in collaboration with Heriot-Watt University and the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory.

Currently I am looking into the problem of active sensing using UAV mounted sensors (chemical, light, wing, etc.). For the purpose I am building probabilistic models of the entire field of interest (using Gaussian Processes for example), to inform sampling picking places of high uncertainty or possible highest readings. I am also interested in modular neural networks and physics engines to try to actively model dynamics of real-world scenes."

I joined this year this society, because I think it will be a huge method to improve my knowledge, but also an opportunity to meet people who can inspire me. I decided to be Academic Coordinator, because I would like to organize useful and interesting talks for postgraduates, but also for undergraduates. What’s more, I would like to create more facilities for students to learn more about Machine Learning and build their path for a successful career. "
