    description: "Currently, I am a PhD student at the University of Edinburgh, working on active sensing with UAV, in collaboration with Heriot-Watt University and the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory.

Currently I am looking into the problem of active sensing using UAV mounted sensors (chemical, light, wing, etc.). For the purpose I am building probabilistic models of the entire field of interest (using Gaussian Processes for example), to inform sampling picking places of high uncertainty or possible highest readings. I am also interested in modular neural networks and physics engines to try to actively model dynamics of real-world scenes."

    description: "Joshua is specialising in Machine Learning (ML) during his Artificial Intelligence masters degree.
He aims to use technology as another medium to love one another.  
His first formal interaction with ML began with a bootcamp hosted by Cambridge Spark 2 years ago coupled with a data science role at Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi. 
His discrete maths undergraduate project/thesis at Warwick University involved using machine learning to help in modelling smart transfer decisions in football. 
Currently, he is also working part time as a data science for a Germany-based venture capitalist, Earlybird. The modules he took/is taking are IAML, MLPR, MLP, RL, PMR and DME. Always here to help ðŸ™Œ"
