    description: "Gonçalo is studying Artificial Intelligence in The University of Edinburgh. He got interested in Machine Learning in an undergraduate project where he had to implement a simple Gradient Descent algorithm. He got increasingly passionate about Machine Learning and all its possibilities after reading books and following online courses on the topic and eventually pursued his newfound dream by applying to Edinburgh. He is interested in using Machine Learning in Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing."
