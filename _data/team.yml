Currently I am looking into the problem of active sensing using UAV mounted sensors (chemical, light, wing, etc.). For the purpose I am building probabilistic models of the entire field of interest (using Gaussian Processes for example), to inform sampling picking places of high uncertainty or possible highest readings. I am also interested in modular neural networks and physics engines to try to actively model dynamics of real-world scenes."
