We are pleased to announce a joint event with Entrepreneurs First and Edintelligence! 

The guest speaker will be Robert Stojnic, who is the co-founder and CEO of Atlas ML.

Atlas ML is a platform that is systematising the world’s deep learning knowledge. Git and GitHub were designed for code, but new software has new ingredients like data and models that require new solutions. 

Atlas ML is building that community and toolkit to solve the workflow problem for machine learning, and ultimately shape the future of software. 

Robert started his career as one of the early core developers of Wikipedia, where he was part of a small team that scaled the website to billions of users. After that he completed a PhD in Computational Biology at Cambridge, where his research focused on the applications of machine learning in biology. After his PhD, he co-founded GeneAdviser and has been the CTO of Factmata, a company that built the first commercial hate speech and fake news detection engine together with researchers from UCL. He met his co-founder at Entrepreneur First and developed the idea for Atlas ML there.
Robert will share his story and the key points in his career that brought him here. 

He'll cover questions like how do you settle on an idea, how do you use your academic backgrounds as an advantage, and most importantly, how do you find a co-founder that propels you? Finally, he'll share advice on transitioning from academia to running a startup.


Please arrive from 5.15pm to get settled in, and no later than 5.30pm. There will of course be beer and pizza after the event!"

NB: Currently sold out - watch this space for more info, and do keep an eye for future events!

</br>
First in a series of public discussion, the event will cover issues around data and privacy, focusing on the impact of the Big Data industry on our privacy and society as a whole.

</br>
Facebook, Google, Amazon, and other websites, financial services companies and even home utility suppliers (through smart devices) are capable of collating vast amounts of personal data. But do we, the society, know what data they collect and what it is used for? Personal data is a commodity that can be sold and bought and used for marketing purposes, but also to manipulate election outcomes and restrict access to services like healthcare or housing. It has been shown that content customised using this data can be used effectively to influence people’s personal beliefs and choices.

</br>
Do you know how your personal data is used? Do you know what control over your personal information you have? Come and find out!

She has spoken extensively on ethical and privacy issues in data science.
</br>
•	Laura Cram is a professor of European Politics at the University of Edinburgh and the head of the NRLabs Neuropolitics Research lab. In her research, she examines how insights from psychology, information science and cognitive neuroscience can help to explain political behaviour and policy processes, using experimental approaches like fMRI brain scanning, behavioural games, face-emotion coding, eye-tracking, physiological hormone testing and big data analysis. She is a regular media commentator and her group's work has appeared on the BBC Daily Politics Show and as part of the BBC MindGames documentary, among others.

As the drama unfolds, more questions emerge: What can artificial intelligence reveal about a 3000-year-old game? What can it teach us about humanity?

    name: "Sharon Goldwater: Language learning in humans and machines"
    published: true
    description: "Computer processing of speech and language has advanced enormously in
the last decade, with many people now using applications such as
automatic translation, voice-activated search, and even language-enabled personal assistants. Yet these systems still lag far behind human capabilities, and the success they do have relies on
machine learning methods that learn from very large quantities of human-annotated data (for example speech data with transcriptions or text labelled with syntactic parse trees). These resource-intensive methods mean that effective technology is available for only a tiny fraction of the world's 5000 or more languages, mainly those spoken in
large rich countries.

This talk will argue that in order to solve this problem, we need a
better understanding of how humans learn and represent language in our
minds, and we need to consider how human-like learning biases can be
built into computational systems. Sharon Goldwater will illustrate these ideas using
examples from her own research. She will discuss why language is such a
difficult problem, say a bit about what we know about human language
learning, and then show how her own work has taken inspiration from
that to develop better methods for computational language learning."

heart rate, blood pressure and temperature."

    description: "One of the first and most fundamental tasks in data mining is what we might call data understanding. Given a dump of data, what’s in it? If modern machine learning methods are effective at finding patterns in data, then they should be effective at summarizing data sets so as to help data analysts develop a high-level understanding of them."

    published: true
    description: "In recent years, the developments in unsupervised learning methods like Variational Autoencoders, Generative Adversarial Networks and Ladder Networks have lead to good results in semi-supervised tasks using neural networks. In this talk will be presented a much simpler class of methods recently proposed for semi-supervised learning (which achieve SOTA in visual tasks). These do not stem directly from any of the unsupervised methods mentioned. Instead they rely on using random inputs perturbations, temporal ensembles and consistency costs to obtain better results much more efficiently."

    published: true
    description: "During this talk, Alan Nichol will discuss several approaches for building conversational software, on a spectrum from hand-coded to completely data driven. Interesting work is happening in the middle ground, where systems don’t rely on a rigid flow chart, but can still guide users and perform useful tasks. By making fewer assumptions, these systems show greater flexibility, but an increased need for training data. Additionally, Alan will talk about trade-offs in using end-to-end training of these models and draw connections with memory-augmented neural networks."
