    published: true
    description: "EdIntelligence is pleased to present, in association with Google DeepMind, an exclusive, pre-release film screening of Alphago, the documentary movie of DeepMind’s rise to fame and the gripping tale of AI vs. Man.
Directed by Greg Kohs with an original score by Academy Award nominee, Hauschka, AlphaGo chronicles a journey from the halls of Oxford, through the backstreets of Bordeaux, past the coding terminals of Google DeepMind in London, and ultimately, to the seven-day tournament in Seoul. As the drama unfolds, more questions emerge: What can artificial intelligence reveal about a 3000-year-old game? What can it teach us about humanity?

    name: "Sharon Goldwater: Language learning in humans and machines"
    published: true
    description: "Computer processing of speech and language has advanced enormously in
the last decade, with many people now using applications such as
automatic translation, voice-activated search, and even language-enabled personal assistants. Yet these systems still lag far behind human capabilities, and the success they do have relies on
machine learning methods that learn from very large quantities of human-annotated data (for example speech data with transcriptions or text labelled with syntactic parse trees). These resource-intensive methods mean that effective technology is available for only a tiny fraction of the world's 5000 or more languages, mainly those spoken in
large rich countries.

This talk will argue that in order to solve this problem, we need a
better understanding of how humans learn and represent language in our
minds, and we need to consider how human-like learning biases can be
built into computational systems. Sharon Goldwater will illustrate these ideas using
examples from her own research. She will discuss why language is such a
difficult problem, say a bit about what we know about human language
learning, and then show how her own work has taken inspiration from
that to develop better methods for computational language learning."

    description: "In this talk Chris Williams will describe the application of a
switching linear dynamical model to monitoring the condition
of a patient receiving intensive care. The state of health of
a patient cannot be observed directly, but different underlying factors
are associated with particular patterns of measurements, e.g. in the
heart rate, blood pressure and temperature."

If modern machine learning methods are effective at finding patterns in data, then they should be effective at summarizing data sets so as to help data analysts develop a high-level understanding of them."

    published: true
    description: "In recent years, the developments in unsupervised learning methods like Variational Autoencoders, Generative Adversarial Networks and Ladder Networks have lead to good results in semi-supervised tasks using neural networks. In this talk will be presented a much simpler class of methods recently proposed for semi-supervised learning (which achieve SOTA in visual tasks). These do not stem directly from any of the unsupervised methods mentioned. Instead they rely on using random inputs perturbations, temporal ensembles and consistency costs to obtain better results much more efficiently."

    description: "During this talk, Alan Nichol will discuss several approaches for building conversational software, on a spectrum from hand-coded to completely data driven. Interesting work is happening in the middle ground, where systems don’t rely on a rigid flow chart, but can still guide users and perform useful tasks. By making fewer assumptions, these systems show greater flexibility, but an increased need for training data. Additionally, Alan will talk about trade-offs in using end-to-end training of these models and draw connections with memory-augmented neural networks."
